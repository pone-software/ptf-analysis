"""
I want this module to contain the necessary code to plot the angular emission data vs Geant4 simulation
data, which we most likely aqcuire from Felix/Jakub. I was thinking to have plot.py to simply plot just 
the angular emission profiles from the PTF by themselves, almost as a quick "initial plot generator",
while this script will contain the more useful comparison plots between data and G4 sims.

You can take a stab at trying to implement this functionality, and include some options in the main.py
command line script to allow the user to request making this plot.

If you feel it's better to just squeeze all of this functionality into the existing plot.py, you can 
do that too and I'll take a look at it and discuss with you.
